# hora
hora is a library / snippet which implements promises / A+ spec

# What exactly is hora 
1. Use google translate and try to translate `time` to spanish. hora is what you get. 
2. In hindi or devanagari script, hora means [ in progress ] 

# What's my mindset while creating this library?
It's a friday night and I'm a boring person. 

I came across Promises / A+ specification somehow. Now I've used promises a lot but I've never
implemented the specification myself. 
So I thought let's just do it. 

What are my initial expectations from this lib?

I don't want it to be the best lib in the world but I still have a few things in mind. 
1. Code should read like a story [ comments should not be required for someone to understand it ] 
2. Should try to follow latest ES stuff 
3. It should do pass the test cases of the specification. 

What's interesting about this lib?

Hora :::: In hinda means "something happening and results are awaited
Hora :::: Google translate for "time" gives Hora 

This library is created more for the purpose of learning and as sucn recommended only for 
learning purposes. 

How to test this lib >>> 
```
npm install hora
