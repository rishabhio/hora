2. In hindi or devanagari script, hora means [ in progress ] 

# What's my mindset while creating this library?
It's a friday night and I'm a boring person. 

I came across Promises / A+ specification somehow. Now I've used promises a lot but I've never
implemented the specification myself. 
So I thought let's just do it. 

What are my initial expectations from this lib?

I don't want it to be the best lib in the world but I still have a few things in mind. 
1. Code should read like a story [ comments should not be required for someone to understand it ] 
2. Should try to follow latest ES stuff 
3. It should do pass the test cases of the specification. 

What's interesting about this lib?

I'm going to document each and every step along with timestamp on how I achieved what I achieved, 
I'm less worried about what I achieve though I do plan to enjoy the journey. 

So here we're 2:21 am in the morning. World is sleeping and let's read the following first of all. 

1. Spec itself 
2. The tiny libraries based on it. 
3. Then we'll proceed for a poc.
